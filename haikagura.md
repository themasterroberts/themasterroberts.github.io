# A Cloud of Ash
### Edogawa Ranpo
#### 1. 
In the blink of an eye, just as if a doll made of mud had crumbled into nothing, the man in front of him slumped limply onto the desk between them. His face pressed directly onto the surface with such force that one wondered if the bridge of his nose would snap. And between the yellow skin of that face and the blue tablecloth flowed a profuse stream of liquid, as bright red as a camellia.

A cast-iron kettle had been overturned in the commotion, and a cloud of ash danced upwards from the large, square brazier of paulownia wood, as if a volcano had erupted, intermingling with the smoke from the pistol, sealing off the room in a dense fog.

In an instant, the world had changed, as if the backdrop to a stage play had come crashing down. A strange feeling came over Shotaro.

“Well, now, what a situation I’ve gotten into,” he said, altogether unconcerned. 

But a few seconds later, he realised that the tip of his right hand was heavy. As he looked down at it, there he saw a glinting miniature pistol belonging to the other party in question, Okumura Ichiro. “I… killed him.” Shotaro felt a lump in his throat as he swallowed. His chest felt hollow, and his heart felt uncomfortably as if it might leap out of him. The muscles of his chin went numb, until eventually, his teeth started to chatter, down through their very roots.

Quite obviously, the first thing he thought of when he returned to his senses was the sound of the gunshot. He himself hadn’t heard anything, apart from an odd vibration in his hands, but a pistol had been fired, after all, and there was no reason why it shouldn’t have made a sound, and so he was worried that someone might arrive after having heard it.

Abruptly, Shotaro stood up and began to pace around the room. Every so often, he stopped in his tracks and listened intently. The exit to the stairs was in the neighbouring room, but he lacked the courage to get close to it. Even now, it seemed as if someone’s face might pop out from the door at any second. He turned back from the stairs.

But after he waited a while, nobody appeared to be on the way – and concurrently, Shotaro’s faculty of memory revived itself. “What exactly am I afraid of? There shouldn’t be anyone downstairs.” Okumura’s wife had gone back to her hometown, and his maid had been sent rather far away on an errand long before Shotaro had arrived. “But wait a moment… what about the neighbours?” Once he had finally collected himself, he stealthily snuck half of his face past the paper sliding doors which the now-dead man had opened, and took a look outside. The second floors of the neighbouring houses which bounded the spacious garden on either side were clearly visible. One appeared unoccupied, with the storm shutters firmly sealed up, and the other had its windows wide open, revealing an empty room with no one in sight. Straight ahead, past a lush grove of trees, on the other side of the wall, was a field in which some young boys playing catch were faintly visible. They appeared oblivious, lost in their game. The sound of the ball colliding with the bat rang out in the autumn air.

The world had gone completely still, as if it knew nothing of the serious incident which had just taken place. Strangely, Shotaro found it simply unbearable. “Perhaps this is all a dream,” he thought to himself – but he needed but turn around to see that eerie, crimson-soaked corpse, lying there as silent as a puppet, to convince himself that clearly it was not.

Before too long, he realised something. It was the time of year for rice harvesting, and out in the neighbourhood fields, blanks were being fired here and there to scare off birds. He’d heard that sound a few times during his conversation with Okumura, as well as during their altercation. No doubt anyone farther away would be unable to distinguish between those blanks and the gunshot that killed Okumura.

So: there was no one else at home, and the sound of the gunshot would go unsuspected. Assuming these statements were fact and all went well, he might still have a way out of this. A sound like a fire alarm went off in the depths of his ears.

“Quickly, quickly, quickly!”

He threw the pistol he had been holding to the dead man’s side and slowly began to move towards the stairs. And just at the moment he took one step forward – a tremendous crash came from the direction of the garden, and the trees’ branches all rumbled loudly.

“There’s someone there!”

A wave of something akin to nausea washed over him as he turned around. But the figures he had expected to see were nowhere in sight. What could that sound have been? Unable to draw any conclusions – or rather, without even trying to draw them – he stood still for a moment. And then, he heard a voice come from the field outside:

“It went into the garden.”

“Oh, it went in? I’ll go and get it, then.”

That was a voice he’d heard before; the voice of Okumura’s younger brother, a secondary school student. Shotaro remembered that somewhere in the depths of his mind, he had recognised Okumura Jiro as the one swinging the bat, back when he had sneaked a look at the field.

Soon enough, he heard the sound of energetic footsteps and the thud of the gate’s back door, followed by Jiro’s heavy breaths as he waded through the thicket, as clear as if he were within arm’s reach. It is uncertain whether it particularly appeared this way to Shotaro, but it took quite some time to find the errant ball. All the while, Shotaro whistled tunelessly and blithely rustled about in the vegetation.

“Aha, here it is.”

His astoundingly loud voice made Shotaro jump. Jiro thereupon rushed back to the field without so much as a glance at the upper floor.

“He has to know that something’s happened here. He was only pretending to look for the ball so that he could check up on the second storey,” Shotaro thought to himself.

“But even if he did suspect it was a real gunshot, he should have no idea that I’ve come to visit. He’s been out in that field since before I arrived. And that big grove of cedars blocks the view of this room from the field, anyway – and even if he could see it, there isn’t a chance he could make out my face from such a distance.”

To confirm his suspicions, he snuck half of his face out past the paper doors and once again looked out at the field. He could see Jiro swinging the bat around as he ran through a gap in the grove, his back towards the house. As he reached the field, he resumed playing, as before.

“I’m fine. I’m fine. He’s oblivious.”

Shotaro wasn’t just laughing off his delusions with those repeated self-assurances, but legitimately trying to force himself into a state of calm.

But he couldn’t sit there mumbling himself, as obstacle number two now awaited him. How could he be certain that that old housekeeper – or anyone else, for that matter – wouldn’t get back before he managed to slip out past the gate? As if he had only now realised this, he rushed down the stairs. Halfway down, he lost control of his footing and came crashing down with a horrible noise, but he appeared practically unconscious of it. Finally, as if he were a bear, he clawed past the slatted door and arrived at the gate.

As he was about to exit, he stopped. He realised he had committed a severe blunder. Later on, he would frequently feel baffled at how could have even considered that at such a point in time.

As he often read the police reports in the newspaper, he had come to learn the tremendous importance of fingerprints. In fact, he had even come to overestimate their importance. And his fingerprints were, without a doubt, all over the pistol he had been gripping up until then. Even if a million other things went in his favour, those fingerprints alone would allow his crime to be detected. Considering this, he couldn’t allow himself to leave. At that moment, returning to the second storey presented itself as a Herculean task, but he drew every bit of willpower he could out from his desperation and re-entered the house. His legs felt as though they had been replaced by prosthetics, and his kneecaps rattled and cracked with each step. 

Just how he had returned to the second storey, how he had wiped the pistol clean, and how he had exited the gate afterwards, he hadn’t the faintest inkling afterwards.

Thankfully, no one was walking past. As this was out in the suburbs, the only buildings were sparsely-placed detached houses, and even in the middle of the day, traffic was prone to intermissions. Shotaro, in something close to a state of delirium, straggled along the country road. “Quickly, quickly, quickly!” the voice inside his ear repeated incessantly, as if it were keeping time, but in spite of this, his pace remained languid. To an onlooker, he would look like another suburban pedestrian, without a care in the world, but in truth, he was practically sleepwalking, unaware of even his own locomotion.


#### 2. 
Shotaro firing the gun was thoroughly unexpected. It had been a spur-of-the-moment action, and he found himself hardly able to believe that he was a murderer. It sounded like a tall tale.

The fact of the matter was that Shotaro and Okumura Ichiro held a fierce enmity towards each other on account of their mutual fixation on a particular woman. That their enmity had continued to amplify upon contact with each other was also fact, and whenever the opportunity arose, the two of them would use some other trivial issue to fan the flames. They would never attempt to address the heart of the issue, turning the slightest of completely unrelated things into fanatical arguments instead.

A further issue was that Ichiro was something akin to Shotaro’s patron. Being naught but a destitute painter, without Ichiro’s financial assistance, Shotaro would have been unable to get by. While difficult for him to admit, he had time and time again been left no recourse but to bow his head as he passed through the entrance of his rival-in-love’s home.

Such had also been the purpose of his visit on this particular occasion. With more bluntness than usual, Ichiro had refused Shotaro’s request for a loan. Shotaro, meeting with such open hostility, felt his blood rush to his head. How unspeakably wretched he looked, bowing his head to beg from his rival-in-love! And there he was, his foe, using his favourable lot in life to his advantage, totally cognisant of Shotaro’s miserable disposition, slowly but surely getting on his nerves. Ichiro insisted that he had no obligation whatsoever to answer to Shotaro’s request, whilst Shotaro asserted that Ichiro had firmly established his position as his financial patron, with a tacit agreement to provide him material assistance, and that to refuse him money at this stage was ridiculous.

Their scuffle increased in intensity. Neither of them could tolerate being conscious of the fact that they were at each other’s throats over something so base as financial matters. Perhaps if that pistol hadn’t been on Ichiro’s desk at the time, such a thing would never have happened, but unfortunately, Ichiro had picked up an interest in firearms, as robberies had been occurring here and there as of late, and so with the intent of using it for self-defence, he had placed it there, bullets loaded and all. This was the very pistol Shotaro used to kill him.

Shotaro was unable to recall what exactly what exactly brought him to pick up the gun and pull the trigger. Usually, no matter how heated the argument, he’d never have even considered shooting the other party. Was it just on impulse? Had he given in to his inner desires? No amount of common sense would lead to a judgement.

That said, he was already a killer, and there was nothing that could be done about it. The two paths that remained to him were to either gracefully turn himself in to the authorities, or to persist in feigning ignorance of the matter. I presume, dear reader, you will already have surmised that of course he chose the latter option. If even the slightest bit of proof that he was the criminal had remained, it is unlikely he would have aspired to do so – but such proof did not exist. There had been nothing but fingerprints. When Shotaro returned to his inn, he spent the whole night replaying the day’s events in his mind. Ultimately, he decided to continue his charade of ignorance.

Ideally, Ichiro’s death would be ruled a suicide, but hypothetically, if murder were suspected, what evidence was there that could pinpoint Shotaro as the culprit? Not a trace was left at the scene of the crime. And besides, not a soul was aware that he had even been in Ichiro’s room at the time.

“What am I getting so worked up for? I’ve always had good luck. I’ve pulled off plenty of little misdeeds here and there, and every single one has gone undetected.”

Saying this, he managed to bring himself some peace of mind. Out of that temporary relief arose a lively persona, altogether unlike that of a murderer – and interestingly enough, the murder had the unexpected side effect of eliminating Shotaro’s competition for the woman over whom he had been fighting. Likewise, the woman, who had favoured Ichiro for his social standing and material wealth, had now lost her target.

“What a lucky man I am!”

That night, Shotaro, in complete opposition to his daytime personality, felt optimistic. Wrapped in his thin bedding, he gazed through the knotholes in the wooden ceiling and turned his mind to his beloved. Indescribably vivid colours, comforting scents, and gentle sounds permeated his mind.


#### 3.
As it turned out, Shotaro’s peace of mind was confined to his bedroom. The following morning, not having gotten a wink of sleep, the very first thing he encountered was a truly dreadful article in the morning papers – and the contents of that article caused his heart to leap out of his chest. There, in a full-page headline, was a report of Okumura Ichiro’s tragic end, with a description of the autopsy for all to see. 

“…considering the bullet passed through the centre of the forehead and the position of the fallen pistol relative to the corpse, it is unlikely that this case was a suicide. As such, the authorities are operating under the assumption that this is a homicide case, and investigations are underway.”

Those few lines, bright and sparkling, were seared into Shotaro’s retinas. Upon reading them, he jumped violently out of his bedding, as if he had suddenly remembered some urgent business to attend to. But what was he to do upon arising? Thinking upon it, he returned to the futon, and as if some terror had made an appearance by his side, he hid his head underneath the cover and curled himself up, staying absolutely still.

Just over an hour later (I leave it to you, dear reader, to imagine just what sort of Hell he must have experienced during that interval), he hastily rose out of bed, changed clothes, and left the room. As he passed through the common area, the innkeeper called out to him, but he offered no response, and it is unclear whether he heard her.

As if he were being drawn in by something, he hurried off towards the home of his beloved. Unless he was able to go see her face now, he might never have another chance to do so. What, then, came of his visit, having travelled a whole ri on the swaying train to call upon her?[^1] Naturally, she had heard of the incident, and she had inferred from the circumstances that there was some reason to mistrust him. While this may not have been the reality of the situation, to an already-hurt Shotaro, it was the only interpretation. What had frightened her in the first place, though, was the air of a cornered beast that hung about him. Upon seeing him, she had gone pale.

Though they had gone to some trouble to meet, the two of them were hardly able to exchange a word. Shotaro could see a shade of distrust in her eyes, and furthermore, he was simply unable to sit still. He announced his departure even before he made it into the main room. This time, with no particular objective in mind, he proceeded to wander aimlessly from street to street. No matter where he went, he was unable to find a place to hide his mere five-shaku body.[^2]

By nightfall, an exhausted Shotaro had no choice but to return to his inn. The innkeeper, upon seeing how he had gained the appearance of a man on his deathbed within a single day, looked at him sideways, and seeing the crazed look within his glare, timidly handed him a single business card. Apparently, someone had stopped by while Shotaro was out. On it, the words “…police station, detective…” were printed. 

“So a detective’s come looking for me, eh? What a riot! Hah!”

The words slipped unthinkingly out of his mouth. But while his mouth laughed uproariously, the rest of his face seemed wholly unamused. Seeing him in such a bizarre state sent the innkeeper into further shock.

His mind was completely absent until late that night. Try as he might to think about something – anything – there was nothing to think about, or perhaps there was so much to think about that he didn’t know where to begin, leaving him in a peculiar condition. But soon enough, his usual night-time optimism resurfaced, and with it, so returned some of his cognitive capacity.

“What is it that I fear so much?”

Thinking back on it, his daytime unease had been meaningless. Even if Okumura Ichiro’s death were ruled a homicide, or if his beloved looked at him with such mistrusting eyes, or even if the detective had come looking for him, it wasn’t as if they had clearly decided he was guilty. They didn’t even have any evidence. It could go no farther than mere suspicion! Or maybe, he himself had just reached the point of jumping at shadows.

Regardless, he could not allow himself to relax. He now saw that those committing suicide would rarely shoot themselves in the forehead, and that it was not unreasonable for the police to deduce that it had been a homicide. And in a homicide case, there must be a culprit. If there was no evidence at the scene of the crime, the police would obviously investigate those who had a reason to wish the victim dead. Okumura Ichiro was a man of very few enemies. It was unlikely anyone besides Shotaro would be of such an opinion. To make matters worse, Ichiro’s younger brother Jiro was well aware of the romance-related conflicts between the two. How could he be sure that word of the matter wouldn’t pass from Jiro on to the police? It was even possible that the detective who’d shown up today had only suspected Shotaro after hearing about it from Jiro.

In Shotaro’s mind, it followed that the path of escape was no longer available. But could there still be a way past all of these obstacles, or was he well and truly trapped? Clear through the rest of the night, he squeezed every last drop of insight in his body out into thought. His unusually agitated condition kicked his brain into overdrive. Every situation imaginable flashed before his eyes.

In a single moment, he pictured the scene of the crime in his mind’s eye. There lay Okumura Ichiro’s body, blood dripping from the hole in his forehead. The sparkling pistol was right there. The smoke in the air. On the stand within the brazier was the cast-iron kettle, its contents half spilled. The cloud of ash that formed from the water, thick and all-enveloping.

“The ash cloud…”

Over and over, he repeated it in his mind. He was certain it contained some clue about what must be done.

“The ash cloud… the wooden brazier… the ashes inside the brazier.”

It hit him. From out of the murky darkness, the faintest thread of light began to glow. Perhaps it was simply another one of those pits of delusion into which criminals are wont to fall. Perhaps an observer would consider it a thoroughly worthless fool’s errand. But as far as Shotaro was concerned, it may very well have been divine inspiration, for which he was thoroughly grateful. After exhaustive consideration, he fully resolved himself to go through with the plan.

Upon doing so, Shotaro, who for two whole days had barely closed his eyes, was met with a frightfully deep slumber. Until noon, he slept like a log.


#### 4. 
The next day, as it finally came time to carry out the plan, he was once again forced to reconsider. The energetic voice of the steamed-bun vendor, clearly audible from the street, the car horns, the bicycle bells, and the brilliant daytime sun illuminating the wooden sliding doors – each and every detail, how positively healthy all of it seemed, in contrast to his gloomy scheme! Could his twisted thoughts actually come to fruition in such a lively, open world?

“No, I mustn’t lose heart. I came up with this after such thought; I have already steeled myself for it. What alternative is there? Now is not the time to falter! If I don’t see this through, all that’s left for me is the gallows! And even if I fail, I’m no worse off. Proceed, proceed.”

Resolutely, he arose. Unhurriedly, he washed his face, finished his meal, gave the morning papers a quick scan as nonchalantly as possible, and as if he were going out on a walk like any other, whistled as he strolled out of the inn.

Where he went and what he did for the next hour or so, you will naturally learn of soon enough, dear reader, and so for the sake of brevity I shall omit it here, proceeding instead to his visit to Okumura Jiro.

There, in the Okumura household, in the very room in which the murder had taken place, Shotaro sat opposite to the younger brother of the deceased man.

“So, do the police have any leads on who the culprit might be?”

After offering some brief condolences, Shotaro immediately launched into the matter at hand.

“Well, I’m not sure,” replied the student, with a degree of unconcealed hostility, as he gazed directly at the Shotaro’s countenance. “My suspicion is they’ll get nowhere. There isn’t a speck of evidence. There’s nothing they could do, even if they had a suspect in mind.”

“But there’s no doubt that it was indeed a murder.”

“That’s what the police are saying.”

“Have they scoured the room for evidence?”

“Well, that goes without saying.”

“I read in some book or other that it’s simply impossible for there to be no evidence whatsoever in any given case. It’s only a question of the human ability to find it. Suppose a lone man were to walk into this room, touch nothing, and immediately depart. At the very least, the dust on the tatami floors would change in some way. The author of that book claimed that by means of a scrupulous scientific investigation, any crime, no matter how ingenious, could be detected.”

“…”

“And here’s another thing. When humans go searching for something, their attention is inevitably drawn to places that are difficult to see, little corners and shadows, and so they ignore the big stuff, the things that are right in front of their noses. It’s an amusing characteristic of our psychology. This means that the best place to hide something is often in plain sight.”

“Just what are you trying to say here? I don’t see how this is the time to be spouting such silly theories.”

“Well, it’s just a hypothetical,” Shotaro said, as if deep in thought, “but consider this brazier. It’s right in the centre of the room, the very first place your eyes go to. Did anyone investigate it? More importantly, did anyone look into the ashes within it?”

“Not that I recall, no.”

“So, you see? Ashes are such an easy thing to disregard. Incidentally, didn’t you mention just a bit ago the brazier was completely covered in ash at the time of your brother’s death? Of course, the kettle must have overturned into the brazier and sent the ash flying everywhere. What we must ask ourselves is what caused it to overturn. To tell the truth, before you arrived, I discovered something rather odd. Here, take a look!”

Saying this, Shotaro picked up the fire tongs and rummaged around in the ashes before retrieving from them a filthy ball. 

“Here it is. Why might this ball have been hiding in the ashes? Don’t you find it peculiar?”

Jiro’s eyes widened in surprise. His forehead ever so slightly displayed a sign of uncertainty.

“Quite peculiar. Why, indeed…”

“I’ve tried my hand at constructing a hypothesis. Tell me, when your brother died, were all of these sliding doors completely shut?”

“They were not. The one just above his desk was left open.”

“Then it might be possible that the culprit who killed your brother – assuming that such a person did indeed exist – that their hand knocked the water out of the kettle, or alternatively, that something came flying through the opening in the doors and collided with it. Somehow, the latter scenario appears a much more natural one, does it not?”

“You mean to say that that ball came flying in from outside?”

“That is correct. Having found it in these ashes, is it not the only reasonable conclusion? And come to think of it, you and your friends often play ball in the field out back, no? What about on that day – were you playing then?”

“We were, yes,” Ichiro responded, feeling more and more concerned, “but there’s no way a ball flew all the way over here.” There was only one ball that made it past the wall, but that one collided with one of the cedars and fell to the ground. And I personally retrieved it, so there’s no way we lost track of one.”

“Is that right? But it did pass the wall, then? Naturally, it must’ve been hit with a bat… But isn’t it possible that it didn’t actually hit that tree, and instead flew over here? Could you be misremembering anything?”

“Absolutely not. I picked the ball up right at the base of the biggest cedar over there. And not a single other one ever passed the wall.”

“Were there any marks or distinguishing characteristics on this particular ball?”

“There were not, but after it went over the wall, I looked for it in the garden, and there it was. There’s no doubt that it was the same ball.”

“Though it’s not inconceivable that the ball you picked up wasn’t the same one you had just hit, but rather one that had been sitting there since long before.”

“Well, maybe, I guess, but something about it doesn’t sit right with me!”

“I don’t see another way to explain it. There was, after all, a ball in the brazier. And the kettle seems to have toppled at just the right moment. You all did hit balls into the garden every so often. And just maybe, in that overgrown thicket, you lost track of them.”

“I don’t know about that…”

“And here’s the most crucial point: Does the time at which that ball was hit match up with the time of your brother’s death?

At that instant, Jiro was taken aback, and his face paled. And after restraining his voice for a while, he replied.

“Now that I think about it, they do seem to match. What a queer coincidence…”

Abruptly, Jiro became restless.

“It can’t be coincidence. This many coincidences can’t happen at once,” Shotaro exclaimed pridefully. “First, the cloud of ash. Then, the ball in the ashes. Then, the ball you all hit over the wall. All of it just around the time your brother died. It all adds up much too well to be coincidence.”

Jiro stared intently at a point the distance, thinking intently. His face was pallid, the tip of his nose covered in miniscule beads of perspiration. Shotaro inwardly rejoiced at the efficacy of his plan. He was aware that the one who had hit the ball in question was none other than Jiro himself.

“I surmise you’re trying to figure out what to say, eh? So this ball flew past that cedar, through these doors, and in front of your brother. And just then your brother, who as you are aware loved fiddling with that gun, had been holding it in front of his face, bullets loaded. The coincidence here is that his finger must’ve been caught on the trigger. And when the ball made contact with his hand, the pistol fired. And so your brother, by his own hand, was shot in the forehead. I actually read of a similar case in a foreign magazine once. And that ball bounced up with its remaining momentum, knocked over the kettle, and landed squarely in the ashes. With that much energy, it’s no surprise how deep in the ashes it ended up. Well, this is all mere supposition. But you must admit, there’s an unusually high probability that it is correct. As I’ve already said, too much of it adds up to be mere coincidence – and doesn’t this interpretation of events substantiate the hypothesis? Now, a culprit might surface at some point, as the police claim, but regardless, if we’re to sit here without a clue in the world until that happens, then don’t we have no choice but to accept my theory as fact for now? What say you?”

Jiro made no attempt to reply. His pose completely unchanged, he sat staring at that distant point. A terrifying sense of anguish was becoming visible on his face. 

“Jiro, I must ask,” Shotaro said, launching into his finishing question, “who was at bat when this ball was launched over the wall and your brother was killed? A friend of yours? He’s committed a serious crime, if you think about it.”

Even then, Jiro made no response. In the corner of his wide-open eyes could be seen the glitter of upwelling tears.

“But, you know, you shouldn’t worry so much,” Shotaro said, thinking this was quite enough. “Even if my conjecture were accurate, all this would be just an accident. And even if by some chance, you yourself had been the one to hit that ball, well, what could you have done differently? It isn’t as if whoever hit that ball went and killed your brother by his own hand. Look at me, just running my mouth. You haven’t done anything wrong here. I’ll be taking my leave once I offer my condolences to your sister-in-law downstairs, so just take your mind off all of this.”

Thereupon, Shotaro descended triumphantly down the very same stairs he had so ungracefully slipped on once before.


#### 5. 
Shotaro had successfully pulled off his audacious plan. If things continued, no doubt Jiro would run off to the police and report to them what he now believed to be the truth. Best of all, if Shotaro were arrested, Jiro could easily clear him of any suspicion. His fabricated theory contained more than enough kernels of truth to have Shotaro released on simple presumption that the situation had transpired as narrated. Moreover, if the fact that he had accidentally killed his elder brother came from Jiro’s own mouth, it would only add that much more verisimilitude to the confession.

At this point, Shotaro was fully able to relax. That detective from yesterday would surely call again sooner or later, but when he did, Shotaro would simply lead the man on, fully prepared to ensnare him in his strategy. 

Just past noon the next day, sure enough, a detective arrived from the station and asked after Shotaro. “Here he is again,” the innkeeper murmured to Shotaro in the barest of whispers. 

He remained calm, even after placing the man’s business card upon his desk.

“Oh, I see. That’s no trouble at all. Please show him in.”

Soon enough, the sound of the detective ascending the stairs reached his ears. Curiously, it sounded not like an individual, but rather two or three of them. “That’s odd,” he thought to himself – and before his waiting eyes appeared first the face of a man he presumed must be the detective, and behind him, unexpectedly, came the face of Okumura Jiro. 

“Well, sir, I’ve already gone and reported the incident to the police.”

Shotaro could just barely restrain his smile.

But who was the third individual behind them? Some sort of shopkeeper? Shotaro felt as if he had seen the man somewhere before. But no matter how hard he racked his brains, he couldn’t place the man in his memory. 

“I take it you are Kawai Shotaro,” the detective said haughtily. “Boss, you’re sure this is the guy?”

To which this “boss” immediately nodded. “Yes, no doubt about it.”

Upon hearing this, Shotaro involuntarily leaped up. He grasped the whole of the situation in an instant. His luck had finally run out. But how exactly had his plan been so efficiently dismantled? He was at a loss as to how Jiro had seen through it. He had hit the ball. The timeframe aligned perfectly. The single sliding door in question had been opened, and the kettle overturned. Just how had he seen through such a realistic trick? Shotaro had to have erred somewhere along the way, but he could not pinpoint where.

“You’re quite a piece of work, aren’t you? I was *this* close to being fooled,” Jiro exclaimed angrily. “But I regret to inform you that your cheap trick created some incontrovertible evidence against you. I didn’t realise it at the time either, but that brazier wasn’t the same one that was there when my brother was shot! You kept blabbering on and on about the ash – I don’t know how I didn’t notice it then and there. You might even call this divine punishment! When the water spilled into the original brazier, the ash hardened up and left the whole thing useless. Our maid replaced it with a new one. We poured some fresh ash in to prime it, and hadn’t touched it since. How, then, could a ball have made its way in? You must have assumed we only had a single brazier in the house, eh? But I caught on last night. I am rather impressed by your scheme – it was an impressive fabrication. I had thought it strange that the ball appeared in a brazier which wasn’t even in the room at the time of the incident. It still didn’t sit right with me. So I took the opportunity to visit our detective here this morning and ask his thoughts on the matter.” 

“There aren’t a lot of stores in this town selling exercise equipment. We traced it right away. I suppose you don’t remember the boss, here? You took a new ball, dirtied it to make it look used, and hid it within the Okumura household’s brazier, didn’t you?” the detective spat.

“You hid it there, and you found it, too. That’s all there is to it,” Jiro proclaimed, smiling.

No doubt Shotaro’s criminal undertakings were foolish, but one must admit, he put quite a bit of care into them.
